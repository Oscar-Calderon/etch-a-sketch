# Etch-a-sketch

Etch-a-sketch project using DOM manipulation. Created using HTML, JS and CSS (grid and flexbox)

# What did I learn

I learned to manipulate the DOM and create a website that had a lot of functionality behind with event listeners.
I also had to pay close mind to the performance of the website, because adding more event listeners lagged the website, so I had to refactor and debug a lot.

# Future Improvements

Responsive website and mobile version with touch controls would be cool.
